In making the connection between statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, it's made clear that there is a difference between the *energy* function $E(X)$ which is a function that takes microscopic states of the system (microstates) and returns the energy. It then becomes a random variable when it acts on the random variable $X$, the corresponding equilibrium distribution over the phase space of the constituent parts of the systems. As E(X) is a random variable, we can take the expectation value with respect to the ensemble and this gives us the internal energy:

$$U = \langle E(X) \lambda$$

$U$ is a thermodynamic variable.

It seems to me that the other thermodynamic variables could also be defined as expectation values if we desired, though in practice we don't do all that. But I am interested in considering the question of we could define the volume of an ideal gas system as an expectation value of the random variable of some microscopic arrangement of the systeme.
