You've might've seen this image floating around:

[Photo of the airplane with spots of bullets highlighted]

The story behind the image is that in World War II, they were trying to figure out how to better fortify planes in order to protect 
pilots. To do so, they collected data on where bullets were located on planes that returned from their mission and reinforced those
places. But this did nothing to improve the mortality of the pilots. Why? Because p

The meme is that this image is now a stand-in for "I have a profound point to make" such that it can be found with an accomponying lesson
even if it has nothing to do with the original World War II story.

A related point is that is that.

And this is a general framework in psychology. If you want to understand how the human mind works in general, it's very instructive
to look at how it breaks: what are common mental illness that people encounter? What are the correlations between these mental diseases.

# Ablation Studies

When you look at neural networks, you see something similar where you can remove the neurons in a network. This allows you to
understand the function of the network. These are called *ablation studies*.

In general, it can be hard to interpret what a neuron means: what is it's function? Neural networks are highly-parametrized
function parameters. Due to the non-linearity of the activation functions, trying to understand what anyone neuron's role
in the network is challenging

# Diffusion Models

The basic idea of a diffusion model is that you degrade a distribution (e.g the distribution of natural images) and then you learn
how it degrades.

Let's say we that we want our target distribution to be a Gaussian.

Then the reversed SDE is

$$dX_t = $$

The point is that the information that you need to reverse the diffusion model is that you degrade it down to the
