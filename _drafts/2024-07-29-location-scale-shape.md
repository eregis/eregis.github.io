For any given parameteric family, there are many different ways that you can parameterize it. For example, for the normal distribution, you can parametrize it via:

* Using the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$
* Using the mean $\mu$ and the variance $\sigma^2$
* Using the mean $\mu$ and the second moment $\mu^2 + \sigma^2$

Going between the most common parametrizations of the normal distribution is pretty straightfoward, so we rarely focus too much on which specific parameterization that we use.

But in general, there are certain "types" of parameters that appear over and over again with different parametric families.
