I've always thought that in another life I might have become an economists. Temperamentally, I think economics would have
been a good fit for me since I love heated debates and critiquing the nitty-gritty technical details of models. Technically,
it would have been a good fit for me.

But it never ended up happening. I only discovered my interest in economics halfway through undergrad. And by then,
I was already pretty deadset of physics and mathematics. And while I enjoyed reading intermediate economics textbooks
and various econ bloggers, I've never seriously grappled with the research frontier in econ.

I'm currently taking a statistical field theory class, and there is work to do with global optimization in Landau theory.
I intuitively started making analogies to conomics. This made me quite curious about economics again: if economics
can help me intuitively grasp statistical physics, perhaps statistical physics can help shed light on economics?

Apparently, great minds think a like because there is a quite a lot of work in exactly this vein. One of the most
popular banners is "Econophysics"---the merger of physics and economics. This textbook by Eugene Stanley, after doing
some googling around, is recommended as an introduction to the field. And at less than 200 hundred pages,
with plenty of graphs, it wasn't a huge time investment either.

What did I find? Well, it was an enjoyable enough read, but I left incredibly disappointed in the
