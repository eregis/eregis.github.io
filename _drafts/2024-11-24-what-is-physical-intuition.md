In physics, there is this common phrase called "physical intuition". While we use it often, actually pining down what "physical intuition"
is hard to pin down. Operationally, the way I think about physical intuition is that it's what seperates mathematicians from phycisist. 
Physics and math are extremely close. More so then sister disciplines like engineer, physics is really close to math. But they aren't
exactly the same. And it's interesting to explore why that's the case.
