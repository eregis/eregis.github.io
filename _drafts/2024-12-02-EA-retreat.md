"Do you think it's real?"
"Hold on. I'm still reading"

We were at out usual spot: a fairly popular Korean BBQ spot in K Town. The server had just finished depositing
the first allottment onto the crucial. My friend lived in California but had flown into NYC for a business trip. I 
rhythmically tapped by index finger against the side of the wood table. Anxiously waiting for my Waygu to reach an edible medium rare. But also waiting to see what Dave thought.

Dave's eyebrows remained hunch in concentration as he continued to read my phone. Without looking up from my phone, he asked, "And who's Tim?"

"A friend of mine. I met him at a picnic a while back, though I'd been following his blog." "He's a quant at Jane Stree" I quickly added, both as a thinly-veiled brag but also in case it was relevant information.

Finally, Dave passed me back my phone. The pork was ready, so he grabbed tongs to put some on his plate. "It's legit."

Thankfully, because of the pandemic, I had saved a lot of money. I had spent the past year binging shows like *Better Call Saul* and watching Jokic tear it up on route to his first MVP. So I did have the money in my savings...

I let out in involuntary nervous chuckle and shook my head. "This is just--" I was pantomining now, somewhat dramatically. "This is just so crazy. Like honestly who do these people think they are. The mysterious cryptic texts. The last-minute demand for an RSVP. An extended weekend in some California mansion rented out from some tech billionare probably." I was laughing now, voluntarily. "Are they not aware what people are saying about them online? I've defended

Dave was getting amused about how worked up I was getting. "So you're not going to go?"

"Of course I'm going!"
