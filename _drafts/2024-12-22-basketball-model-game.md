Basketball is a model game. My first real exposure to statistics was pouring over the favorite statistics 
of my favorate athletes. Though my basketball fandom has waned in recent years due to other parts of my life
taking a greater priority, I can still recite some of my favorite statlines. 45-15-5; 81;

But my understanding of stats really happened due to getting into all sorts of arguments. These arguments where at first on BleacherReport. Then eventually I graduated to Reddit where I would get into arguments on the nba subreddit.
And winning these--arguments--which really mattered to me.
