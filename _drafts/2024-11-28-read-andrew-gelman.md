I came into my PhD with the expectation of specializing in biophysics. But after a year and a half, I've now switched to 
working with a statistics professor on physics-inspired sampling algorithms. This might seem like a sudden mid-PhD pivot, 
but I've actually been interested in statistics---not statistical physics, but *statistics*---for many years now.

While it's hard to pin down exactly when I became interested in statistics, I'm pretty sure that my first introduction to 
academic statistics was through the work of Andrew Gelman. Gelman is a renowned statician at Columbia who has 
contributed to many areas of both theoretical and applied statistics, though I believe he's best known for his work on Bayesian modeling.

Gelman is a *truly* prolific blogger. As far as I can tell, he's blogged daily for over twenty years---all while continuing to publish
books, research articles, teach classes, and travel for conferences. He's so organized and productive that he is able to schedule
out blog posts *months* in advance. I have no idea how he does it.

He is best known for his work in Bayesian statistics. The foundation of Bayesian statistics is a simple but powerful formula
called *Bayes theorem* that tells you how to update your subjective probability of an event happening when receiving new information.

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B) P(A)$$

To briefly explain the formula: Let's say you are a New York Jets fan and you're sitting on a couch one lazy Sunday afternoon to watch
your favorite football team. You care about the probability that 

It's hard to summarize all the work that falls under the label of "Bayesian statistics". Though a common throughline is that in Bayesian
statistics, you have to specify a *prior*.  Bayesian statistics is to be contrased with
the older *frequentist* statistics. Frequentist statistics is basically the statistics that you would learn in a statistics methods class
if you are in an undergrad social major.
