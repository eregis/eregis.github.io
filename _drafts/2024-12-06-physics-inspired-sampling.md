Since I've switched to working in statistics, I've had trouble explaining what I work on to people. Specifically, I have
trouble explaining why me, a physics PhD student, would be working in statistics. The phrase that I've settled on is that I work
on "physics-inspired sampling", but I'm not sure that most people (even other STEM PhD students) have a clear picture of
what that exactly means. So I think it would be useful to talk about some different sampling algorithms that fall
under the label of physics-inspired sampling.

# Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm

This is the one that started it all. The way that Metropolis Hastings

# Langevin Sampling

This is called the Langevin equation.


You can combine Langevin sampling

# Hamilton Monte Carlo

# Diffusion Models
