Jared Kaplan is a former conformal field theorists who switched to machine learning. He's most famous for being a co-founder
of Anthropic, one of the leading AI companies. He's also known (in the context of machine learning) for his work
on machine learning.

I am taking a Physics of AI class that is using Jared Kaplan's lecture notes as the main resource for guiding the course.
I decided to give them a quick read as---based on the title---I am exactly the target audience. What I found surprised me: these lectures
notes are *really* good. I hadn't heard of them before, so I wasn't expecting. I would say that if you are a
physicists looking to learn more about traditional machine learning (not machine learning that is specifically relevant to physics),
these are one of the first places that I would look for.
