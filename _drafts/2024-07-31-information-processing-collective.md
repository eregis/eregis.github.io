What has there been done on the information processing in collections of bacteria?
I would especially like to juxtapose it to the individual cell analysis

(1) What is the signal? In singular bacteria, the signal can be taken to the time derivative of the concentration. But in population, it would seem that the most natural "signal" wouldn't be a scalar, but a field?
(2) What is the behavioral model, in ecoli, we have that the signal affects the tumble rate: so we are modeling the bacteria as a simple two state system where each have their own motion rules. But with phenotypic diversity, it seems more complicated than that? Are there distinct "modes" of a population? The behavioral response would seem to be a function of (a) the spatial reorganization of the various phenotypes constituting the population (b) how those individual phenotypes respond to environmental changes
(3) The performance metric. Might be climbing the gradient; could also be some sort of population-maximizing objective
(4) Quantifying the information? In singular bacteria, there are three time series whose statistics we want to quantify: the signal, the activity ("the internal state"), the behavior. We already talked about the potential difficulties with the signal and the behavior. But what about the internal state of the population? It would have to involve the activity of the individual bacteria as well as the quorum signallers, right?

Thoughts?
