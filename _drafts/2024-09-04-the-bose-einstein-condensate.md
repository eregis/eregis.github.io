In my most recent qualifying exam, I got a question on the Bose-Einstein condensate. I had encountered similar problems in the past, but in doing revisions for the qualifying exams, it's the first time that the conceptual idea actually clicked for me.

The idea behind the Bose-Einstein condensate is that we have an integral that we define that must have some finite value (which will turn out to be the total particle number). When we take the limit.

Okay, so my initial question about the Bose-Einstein condensate
