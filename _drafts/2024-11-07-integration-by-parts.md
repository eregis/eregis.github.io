Most of my longest-lasting friendships started innocuous enough.

Consider [perhaps made up story about a good friend of mine]

And this is the norm for most friendships. In movies, when major characters meet for the first time, there are all these different
audiovisual cues: the introduction of a particularly catchy leitmotif, a trendy, iconic, signature costume style, the cinematic
framing and lingering eye of the camera. Without being told, we the audience *know* that this is someone important that we need to
keep in mind going forward.

This is kind of how I feel about integration by parts.
