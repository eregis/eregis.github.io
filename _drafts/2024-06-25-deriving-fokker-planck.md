This is yet another "folklore" derivation where everyone knows the derivation, but it's hard to find on the internet in one neat place.

A key idea in probability theory is differentiating between *random variables* and the *probability density function* of the random variables.

For example, let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables. There is a big difference between Z_1 = \frac{1}{2}(X + Y) and Z_2 whose pdf is a mixture of the pdfs of X and Y: h(x) = \frac{1}

The Langevin equation is an equation about stochastic differential equation. It's about an infinetsimal version of the algebra of random variables.

The Fokker Plank equation is about the probability density function where we have a multivariable function p(x,t) where for at any given time slice, we have a well-behaved probability density function.

How do we go between the two?
