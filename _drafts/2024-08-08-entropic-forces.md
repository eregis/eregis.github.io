John Baez talks about entropic forces. The framework he uses to talk about it is so simple that I'm surprised I haven't seen it explained this way.

Nature is performing a constant optimiziation problem where it wants to minimize the energy of a system. That's why balls roll downhill.

In thermodynamics, we replace the energy with the free energy. Nature is constantly trying to minimize the free energy of the system.
