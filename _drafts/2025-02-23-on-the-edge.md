Me and Nate Silver have a lot in common. We both love poker, both for its grungy, hoodies-and-sunglasses aestique and also
as a battleground to test one's risk-taking mettle. We're both huge NBA nerds who love the Big Apple and dabbling in prediction markets. 
We both love to chop it up with effective altruists and rationalist-types. Nate is my kind of guy.

When I heard that he was writing *On The Edge*---a book attempting to tie all of these seemingly disparate interests together---I was sold. 
I could never quite articulate it, but I always sensed that despite their superficial differences---poker, sabermetrics,
effective altruism---they all select for a certain cognitive style, a certain type of brain. 
It has something to do with the tension between believing in scientific reductionism 
(the power to quantify and use data to refine our models of reality until we converge to truth) 
while also acknowledging its limits---recognizing that stochasticity, randomness, and model uncertainty can only be held at bay, 
never permanently defeated.


In theory, I should have loved this book. I am pretty much exactly the target audience. But perhaps I was *too* much
in the target audience. While most parts of the book were individually interesting to me, they were also deeply familiar. Just
when I was starting to feel settled in, Nate would whisk off to the next leg of the tour. And somehow---despite Silver's best effort---
the whole never quite become more than the sum of the parts.

I love poker. While the rules of poker are a bit weird at first, once you get into it, it’s a rich game that is *the* best introduction to game theory and thinking probabilistically that I know of. I learned from the book that Von Neumann heavily relied on poker examples in his seminal book on game theory, and I don’t find that surprising in the slightest.

I like effective altruism and rationalism. Rationalism, specifically, is the online commiunity that I identify the most with. It has by far the highest density of smart and dynamic thinkers. And fitting the theme of the book, rationalism is filled with intellectual risk-takers: not just smart people, but smart people who are willing to consider out-there ideas that are either taboo or would be seen as ridiculous in “polite” society. Effective altruism I am less enthusiastic about, but I still enjoy their mission quite a lot. On the margin, we need more hyperoptimmization, number-crunching, and first principles utilitarian thinking in society. While I don’t love the cultural aspects of effective altruism that they borrow from broader elite culture, there is still a real sense in which I feel a sense of kinship with them. Whenever I pop in on the EA forum, I vibe with the discussion topics, the jargon, the analytic and curious way of looking at the world.I like artificial intelligence and Sillicon valley. Since stumbling on the Sequences many years ago, I’ve been keeping a close eye on developments in artificial intellligence. This interest became more serious with the release of AlphaZero in 2017 and became one of my number one concerns with the realease of GPT-3 in 2020. I agree with the rationilist consensus that AI is the single most important discussion topic right now, and very little else ranks close in importance. I also enjoy tech as a topic, especially when contrasted with other elite power sources like academia. Tech founders seem to have a high concentration of dynamic and contrarian thinkers. I appreciate what tech founders like Patrick Collison and Paul Graham and among other bring to the table not only in terms of their influence on the development of the tech industry, but as broad, polymathic thinkers in general.

What all of these different areas have in common is a relationship with risk-taking. While many parts of society are staid, stale, and stagnant, poker, tech, and rationalism, all implicitly and explicitely promote a probabilistic way of looking at the world which is more risk-neutral and more about maximizing expected value.Nate Silver calls this collection of people The River, after the final card that is turned over in poker (which is when fortunes are either made or lost; and where the boldest bluffs, folds, and hero calls are made).

The thesis is despite all of these topic areas being superficially different, they actually are all deeply similar. In appendix, Silver notes that he originally pitched three books to his editor, but the editor liked the idea of writing a book on gambling the most. But then, somehow, the book on gambling ended up fusing with the two other reject ideas.

I can’t help but feel like the book ultimately didn’t become more than the sum of its parts. It felt a bit too much like “This is the cool shit that I’ve been into.”Part of the problem might be that weirdly enough, I might be too much in Nate Silver’s target audience. In addition to the topics that I already mentioned, me and Nate are also both super into the NBA. Usually it’s good to read authors who are similar, but in this case, it feels like I am not being exposed to new ideas that I haven’t considered. My biggest complaint of the book is that it felt weirdly shallow and I didn’t feel like I learned that much. I would have much preffered a deeper book on of the selected topics, rather than the book that I got.

An interesting part of this book is that I didn’t realize how much of Nate’s identity was wrapped up in being a poker player. The structure of the book is that the journey goes “up River”. Downriver is poker and gamlbing, Midriver is tech. And Upriver is effective altruism and rationalism. The idea is that farther up river you go, the less the River becomes about concrete applications of risk-taking and the more it becomes about intellectual risk-taking. He decides to start concrete as the vocabulary that he uses to talk about risk, probability, and game theory are heavily derived from poker, so it makes sense to start with it.

While Nate obviously feels kindred spirit with many of the Riverians that he discuss, it’s only with Poker players that he uses “we” without qualification. The way he discusses poker is wistful, almost like an old man in a rocking chair reminsicing about his first love, The One Who Got Away.Sometimes, the analogies felt a bit strained. For example, on the section of language models, he attempts to provide a quick explanation of how large language models. He uses an analogy with an orchestra that confused me—and I feel fairly confident that I could understand the mathematics behind how transformers work if I got my hands dirty and decided to study it. And he then tries to make a connection between language models and poker that felt a bit forced. The idea behind the analogy is that both language and poker require on integrating small contextual clues to ; which, I mean, I guess is true. But I don’t think this is super deep or insightful analogy that dovetails well with the River theme. Earlier in the book, he talks about Riverians are known to be decouplers: they can consider information without taking in the whole context, allowing them to consider politically-charged information without getting distracted from the key idea. But which is it? Are Riverians decouplers who The book spends a lot of time talking about SBF. I ultimately found this to be sort of week and boring, for a couple reasons. One is that I think it’s been done better elsewhere. If you want to understand the FTX saga, including psychoanalysis of the key people involved, I would recommend Milky Egg’s breakdown of what happened at Alamena, Zvi Mowshowitz post on the aftermath called “Sadly, FTX” as well as the book reviews of Michael Lewis’ Going Infinite by both Zvi and Matt Levine. Oh, and also this Patrick Mckenze post speculating the relationship between SBF and Tether.

Given these above sources, Silver doesn’t add anything too new. He doesn’t have the truly deep insights into effective altruism that someone like Zvi has. Nor does he have the technical knowledge that people like Levine and Mackenzie have. While Silver did have access to nver before seen interviews with SBF, including after the collapse of FTX. The quotes were not that interesting; just a lot of rationalization covering the obvious fact that he was going to spend the better part of his adult life behind bars. Indeed Nate Silver himself undermines the interestingness of SBF, saying that SBF seems kinda smart, but he never really understood all of the boy genius hype surrounding him. And that’s my take on SBF: despite being the center of one of the biggest financial frauds in history and being affiliated with one of the most intellectually dynamic and interesting subcultures, SBF is, above all else, weirdly boring for a supervillian. He just seemed like a guy who was incredibly oppurtunistic and willing to lie and deceive to get his way, and he fit an image of what people thought a wunderkind fintech founder is supposed to look like between the shorts, power naps, and floppy Jewish hair.

The counterpart of the River is the Village. If the River is risk-neutral, then the Village is risk-averse. If the River is dynamic, the Village is static. If the River is tech and the quantitative parts of finance, then the Village is academia, the media, and the government. It’s a familiar enough typology. Silver doesn’t spend too much time on the village, except in passing to contrast it with the River or when the River-Village cultural conflict is especially salient in a given context (e.g the tech-media power struggle).

Effective altruism, and the adjacent but more loosely defined intellectual movement called "rationalism," are important
parts of the River on their own terms. In some ways, in fact, they are the most important parts.
