So I'm learning about fluctuation dissipation: the idea is that in generalized systems, the same microscopic mechanisms that cause a system to revert back to equilibrium is also the same microscopic mechanisms that cause fluctuations about the equilibrium. The key idea is that, due to fluctuations and dissipation being balanced at the equilibrium, we have that there is a connection between the magnitude of the fluctuations and the strength of the dissipation.

A lot of the mathemetical derivations for this mathematics uses linear response theory. I've seen this both in original literature like Ryugo Kubo's formulation, but also more modern pedagogical treatments like Zwanzig's textbook on Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics.

I am studying the bacterial chemotaxis system. And something that I see is that we don't have the simplified picture that we would expect to see from linear response theory. 

What I mean is that, experimentally, you can measure the response function of the activity with respect to an impulse signal. And you can also measure fluctuations of the activity when there is no external signal. And what you see is that the time scales for each of these are not the same--they are within the same order of magnitude, but they are meaningfully different.

Why would that be?
