I didn't get much out my two semesters of Quantum Field Theory. But one idea that managed to make an impression on me is the idea of "effective theories". The idea that different models of reality might be applicable at different "scales" wasn't invented by quantum field theorists--at least I don't think. It seems like a fairly old idea. But by way of the renormalization group, this idea of how our physics changes as a function of scale is made sophisticated and mathematical, rather than simply philosophical.

We sometimes represent Markov processes by directed graphs, where each node reprents a different state and each weighted directed edge represents a reaction.
