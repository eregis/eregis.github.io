A variational principle is a way to represent a quantity as the solution to some optimization problem. Variational
principles

At a deep level, where these information-theoretical variational principles come from is the second law of thermodynamics: that the
entropy increases over time. When you consider a closed system, then this leads to the microcanonical ensemble--where given
the energy of the system, the system will have be evenly distributed across the energetic hypersurface. 

But when you consider systems that allow you to exchange heat or volume or particle number, the maximize energy principle 
gets generalized into a minimize free energy principle. The reason why we want to minimize the free energy of a system is that
what we "really" care about is maximizing the entropy of the entire universe--the system under consideration and everything else. But
there is a trade-off: e.g for most systems, increasing the system's energy will increase its entropy (higher energy hypersurfaces have
larger phase space volume which is the generalization of multiplicity)

There is also a theme of duality in thermodynamics.
