It was Lebron's 40th birthday a couple of weeks ago. Congrats to the king! The best years of my life
were watching the Big 3 in Miami dominate the NBA as an impressionable teenager.

He is playing remarkably well for his age. For basketball, a player's peak physical condition is in their mid 20s,
with their peak playing ability coming perhaps a bit later if they hone their skills and basketball IQ to countervail
the gradual decline in athleticism. In basketball years, forty is geriatric. Most players are long-retired.

But chug away he does. On reddit, I was reading one of those threads commemorating him when I came across a comment saying something like "Lebron is shooting better than ever!!If you ignore that stretch where he missed 20 threes in a
row, he is shooting 43% from three." Now, I don't want to pick on his commentator to much. He was just trying to 
express appreciation for his favorite athlete. But I'm never quite sure what to make of these sorts of arguments.
Can't you make this sort of argument for anything?

There is a famous theorem in statistics that says that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. 

But when is this not true? The short answer

The statement that I'm making seems to be equivalent to a kind of exchangeability: that each three point shot
is drawn from some time-invariant "urn" such that the sequences of shots don't carry any other information
that just consider the total number of makes.

But we know that's not exactly true.
