Every once in a while you discover someone who just *gets* it?

They have all the right taste in research topics, all the right intellectual influences. Their notation is crisps and intuitive, and they know how to balance verbal explanations with mathematical derivations.

I've had the pleasure of discovering the work of Pankaj Mehta, a statistical and biophysicist at Boston University. He's on the younger side for a professor, and BU doesn't have the same name-brand appeal for biophysics as a Boston University. But man oh man: everytime I read another Pankaj Mehta paper, I'm reminded why I decided to go into biophysics in the first place.

So what are his research interest?
