You've probably heard of the covariance $\sigma^2$ (and it's $d$-dimensional generalizattion the covariance matrix $\Sigma_d$).
But you might not have heard of 

To make an analogy, in intro-level physics. You learn about two types of circuits: series circuits and parallel circuits.
A natural question to ask is: how do you find the resistance of the composite circuit given the resistances of the individual
resistances of the circuits.

I wonder if when learning the inverse process of the diffusion model if there is something interesting going 
on with the precision matrix.
