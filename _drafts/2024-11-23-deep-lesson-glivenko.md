Today's blog post will be inspired by the structure of a Catholic mass.

First, will be the gospel. There is a theorem in statistics called the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. It says that empirical distribution
function uniformly converges to the true distribution almost surely. 
(If you don't know what an "empirical distribution function" is or what it means to "uniformly converge",
that will be explained shortly.) I will walk through the proof which is short and not too complicated.

Then I will give a sermon

The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is not a mind-bender like Godel's incompleteness theorem where you're like "What? No way! But that's impossible!"
There are theorems where even when you know that they're true and even when you've personally walked through the proof
step-by-step, there's a part of you that is simply refuses to believe.

This theorem is not like that. It's more like the theorem in number theory that there are infinitely primes.
Whenever, I first learned in school what a prime number is, I assumed that there were an infinitely many of them--even if I couldn't
construct a formal proof of the fact. Glivenko-Cantelli's theorem was also something that I simply took as a matter of faith. 
It seems pretty intuitive that in the limit as your sample size goes to infinity, your sample "becomes" your population.
