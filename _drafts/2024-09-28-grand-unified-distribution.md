I'm trying to think if there is a connection between the GUT and each distribution being considered as the Gibbs ensemble for some energy landscape $E(x)$.

Well, for the exponential distribution $E(x)$ is

Okay, I see: So the Gibbs ensemble corresponds to  $E(x) = - \ln Z - \ln p(x)$
So if we view this is a Gibbs Ensemble, then we are saying that the energy landscapes for most distributions tend to be the derivative of low-level rational functions. 

So what's the hypothesis here. For something like the exponential and normal distribution, their prevalence can be interpreted from a maximum entropy perspective where they correspond to the maximum entropy distribution for constrained mean and contrained variance, respectively. What's the physical interpretation of the derivative of the energy landscape with respect to some parameter that is indexing the number of different microstates.

Why would the generic Hamiltonian be a small fraction

It perhaps helps to see which distributions require 

Another wrinkle that I didn't fully appreciate is that we have a leading 1/x term in the GUT. Why is that the convention? Sure, it's more expressive. But is that it?
