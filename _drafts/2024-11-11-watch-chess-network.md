While there is a couple of chess YouTube channels that I enjoy, one of them clearly stands at the top: ChessNewtork. I've already talked about how ChessNetwork's video on AlphaZero versus Stockfish got me back into chess. But there is a lot to recommend about ChessNetwork.

First, there are the bread-and-butter of every chess channel: the game analysis videos. What does ChessNetwork do that sets him apart from other channels like agadmator or GothamChess?

If I could compare him to agadmator, I would say that he spends more time on the high-level concepts and also tends to spend a lot more time on the early-mid game. With someone like agadmator, he is good for highlighting variations. Chess games are just a series of forks: you have two moves that both seem good, but how do you decide between them? Or there is move that complicates the position, but you can't tell if at the end, you'll be the one to come out on top. Do you pull the trigger? Agadmator is great at playing out the variations, explaining why the player playing the game opted to not pursue a certain line.

But Jerry is much better at highlighting the key features of the position. In the early mid game is usually when key "static features" of the position come into play. These are things like the pawn structure, or some long-lasting material balance (e.g bishop pair for one side versus knight and a bishop). He will then spend quite a while not even calculating variations, but just espousing the long-lasting implications of these static features of the position, what sorts of plans.

I like Jerry's analysis because it gets at the heart of why I find interesting. Like in many optimization settings, there is this tension between global goal. One the one hand, due it's being a game, the overall goal in chess is quite straightfoward: checkmate the enemy king. But you have to take local actions in order to try to acheive that global goal.

Another aspect of Jerry's content that I enjoy is the 3 hour long bullet marathons--especially when he's shadowing Carlsen. Rapid chess with good commentary is wildly entertaining to see live. And Jerry does a great job keeping pace with the best players in the world---even if there can be a couple of moments where the action is too fast even for him. I would say that you haven't lived life until you've 

Jerry also has the most wonderful videos on engine chess.
