If you look at the names of the great probability theorists, a striking pattern emerges: they all go by their initials.

For example,

*E.T Jaynes
*R. A. Fisher
* I.J. Good

What's going on here?

Well for one, the other thing that leaps out about the great probability theorists is how Russian they are. Especially in the 19th century, when you have greats like Markov, Russians took the lead in terms of the great probability theorists.
