In a statistical physics class, you will start with mean field theory. This gets you quite far: and allows you to derive
e.g critical exponents for the lattice model.

But eventually, you will hit the end of the road for mean field theory. The way that this is presented is that
there is a discrepency between the scaling of the correlation function as dicated by dimension analysis and 
the observed scaling function. This is dramatic because, for your entire career up to that point, dimension analysis has
*always* come through.

The grand reveal is that the lattice spacing is behind the discrepancy.

A trope is a convention in fiction. One of the most classic tropes in mystery novels is that The Butler Did It.
It refers to the now cliche plot twist that the humble butler introduced at the beginning as a completely inconsequential
figure, was actually operating from the shadows the entire time. I'm sure it blew the mind when it was first invented
the 18th century, but every mystery reader knows to be suspicious of seemingly inconsequential.

Physics isn't a work of fiction, but sometimes there is still this element of masterful story telling. At the beginning of the
statistical field theory class, you are introduced at the lattice.

And then you will go through over a hundred page of concepts working in this continuum and not once will the lattice spacing
be mentioned and then suddenly when all hope seems lost---Bam!---*the lattice spacing did it*.
