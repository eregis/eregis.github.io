There is an interesting stackexchange thread that I stumbled on:

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/51534/is-there-a-lagrangian-formulation-of-statistical-mechanics

It asked: Is there a Lagrangian formulation of statistical mechanics.

In normal statistical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is the fundamental object. That can be seen whether you think in terms of study:
